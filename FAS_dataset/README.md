NZ_FAS dataset within the New Zealand National Seismic Hazard Model (NZ NSHM 2022; https://nshm.gns.cri.nz/) program, a dedicated Fourier spectra amplitude database (2022NZ-FAS) was built for future applications, such as: site-response evaluation and ground motion development.
The NZ-FAS Strong Motion intensity measure database was developed by Manea et al., (2023) and  contains uniformly processed smoothed Fourier amplitude spectra (FAS) for individual components, effective amplitude spectrum (EAS) of combined horizontal components, significant durations, cumulative absolute velocity (CAV), arias intensity (AI) along with a comprehensive compilation of source metadata (partly based on Hutchinson et al. 2024), source-to-site distances, and site metadata (Wotherspoon et al., 2023).  It comprises all the local events with moment magnitudes in the range MW 3.5-7.8 for crustal seismicity and MW 4-7.8 for subduction seismicity recorded by Geonet strong motion network (GNS Science, 2021) starting with 2000.
